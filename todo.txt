/// Need to use hashmaps instaed of arrays
/// what if we convert all numbers to number 6
/// What if we make a primeGenerator method to create an object output with index of that prime.
/// What if we draw the line for each integer value of kk in equation like: (n-k)/(6k+1) = kk
/// what if we use polar coordinates for drawing indicies?
/// What if we check fractal logic, as we have something like these trends for non-primes:
    - (6n+1) = (6k+1)(6kk+1)
    - (6n+1) = (6k-1)(6kk-1)
    - (6n-1) = (6k+1)(6kk-1)
    - (6n-1) = (6k-1)(6kk+1)


/// Is there a way to use fourier series??
